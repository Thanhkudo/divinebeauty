Therefore, at a young age the first wrinkles make their appearance on our skin. Over the years, due to the combination of sun exposure ,natural gravity ,excessive facial movement and genetic pre- disposition,our skin\u2019s collagen weakens and these wrinkles multiply and become deeper. Anti \u2013wrinkle injections contain the active ingredient called botulinum toxin ,which is a purified protein produced by the Clostridium Botulinum bacteria, and acts a neuromodulator. A small amount of neuromodulator is injected into the muscles that are responsible for creating wrinkles and by temporarily blocking certain chemical signals from nerves, which cause these muscles to contract, it relaxes them. Thus, the lines and the wrinkles diminish dramatically and the skin over them looks smoother and more youthful. The areas in which Dysport is injected contain:<br>\u2022 Horizontal forehead lines also known as glabellar lines<br>\u2022 Frown lines<br>\u2022 Crow\u2019s feet also known as laughter lines<br>\u2022 Bunny lines<br>\u2022 Marionette lines<br>\u2022 Gummy smile-Smile with over exposure of the upper teeth and gums<br>\u2022 Chin-Peau d\u2019orange<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our face\u2019s skin shrinks, stretches and moves in different ways &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":1159,"template":"","treatment-categories":[14],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/arielmedical.gr\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/treatments\/871"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/arielmedical.gr\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/treatments"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/arielmedical.gr\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/treatments"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/arielmedical.gr\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1159"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/arielmedical.gr\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=871"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"treatment-categories","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/arielmedical.gr\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/treatment-categories?post=871"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
